libsvm-2.84_varma-np
--------------------

This is a patched version of libsvm-2.84 (somehow hacky ;-)

It's used by pyVarmaMKL (through the python bindings). 

The only problem supported by this version is a 2-class SVM classification with precomputed kernels (i.e. C-SVC, PRECOMPUTED, 2 labels only).
